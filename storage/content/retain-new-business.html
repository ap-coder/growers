<p itemprop="text">You have to do a lot of things to run a successful home services business. You have to do good work, be responsible with projects by showing up on time and finishing on schedule, and offer good customer service.</p>

<p itemprop="text">However, perhaps the most vital piece of the puzzle is attracting and retaining new clients. Without customers, you don’t have a business! Let’s look at our top tips for getting new clients and keeping them happy.</p>

<h2 itempprop="about headline">1. Build a Solid Reputation</h2>

<p itemprop="text">Even in the day and age of the Internet (or perhaps even more so) your reputation matters. People want to know how you’ve treated past customers and the quality of work that you’ve delivered. Tiny negative influences can have a dramatic effect. </p>

<p itemprop="text">For this reason, you want to focus on creating a delightful customer experience through every step of the process. Respond promptly to emails and phone calls, show up for work on time, and always put your 110% into every job and turn out quality work.</p>

<p itemprop="text">When you do get those inevitable bad reviews here and there, remember that how you respond to them can make a huge difference. Always leave a response, but wait until you cool down if necessary. An emotional response will only make you look bad.</p>

<h2 itempprop="about headline">2. Social Media</h2>

<p itemprop="text">On average, people in the US spend 2 hours and 3 minutes on social media each day! If your business is not already on social media, it’s time to open an account. With all that time that people are spending on the platforms, they’re sure to see your ads. All you have to do is make sure that the right people see them. </p>

<p itemprop="text">For now, social media advertising is rather inexpensive. You can run a few campaigns to get a feel for what works. Don’t forget to experiment with different types of photos and headlines to see what gets people’s attention the best. </p>

<h2 itempprop="about headline">3. Recommendation Websites</h2>
<p itemprop="text">Develop your online presence with recommendation websites as well. Customers will frequent these types of sites, looking for quality contractors. They feel more secure knowing the recommendation website of their choice is endorsing a potential contractor. </p>

<h2 class="text-primary">A New Type of Recommendation Website</h2>
<p itemprop="text">Unfortunately, there is a major flaw with those recommendation websites. Home services businesses that can pay more tend to be featured more often and more favorably.</p>

<span class="text-primary font-size-lg">Isn’t there a better way of doing things? Now there is!</span>

<p itemprop="text">Locate Contractors works differently. We host a forum that allows customers to chat with professionals and ask questions about DIY work. </p>
<p itemprop="text">As you answer more questions and help more customers, you’ll grow your profile — earning experience points and badges along the way. A robust profile builds trust with customers and gives them the in-depth understanding of your business they crave. </p>

<p itemprop="text">Plus, if the customer ends up not being able to figure out the problem on their own, they’ll need to hire a contractor. If you were so helpful on the forum, it’s likely they’ll pick you to complete the work.</p>
