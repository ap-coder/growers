<p>Looking to bring your home into the 21st century? There are lots of fun remodeling projects you can take on to modernize your home.</p>

<p>However, pause a moment before you start knocking down walls for your 1970 ranch house remodel and think about a few things. When the dust settles, you’ll be glad you stopped to consider these 4 things before remodeling your home.</p>

<h2>1. Consider Your Long-Term Plan</h2>

<p>How long do you plan to live in the home? This will make a huge impact on the kind of remodel you should undertake. Your family dynamic is one way right now, but what will it be like in 10 or 20 years? For example, you might have aging parents that move in with you or you might become the aging parents whose adult child (and perhaps little grandchildren) come to live with you. </p>

<p>Don’t forget to consider potential space needs such as a work-from-home office that you didn’t need before.</p>

<p>If you plan to turn this into a legacy home, it might be worth investing in better quality materials such as a metal roof or high-quality flooring that is made to last for several decades. </p>

<h2>2. How’s Your Home’s Skeleton?</h2>

<p>You don’t want to start knocking down walls only to discover that the home’s structure can’t handle the changes (even though it should have been able to). Perhaps the original construction was poorly done and now you have expensive renovations on your hands to make sure it is strong and safe. </p>
<h2>3. Consider the Cost of Remodeling vs Buying a New Home</h2>

<p>Some home renovations are extremely costly. What if you wanted to do a split-level remodel and raise or lower the front door to get rid of that awkward entrance? The price is going to go up fast. At some point, it will make more sense to buy a new house rather than dump a bunch of money into remodeling your current one.</p> 

<p>However, if you want to do a simple bathroom remodel or a basic 70s house exterior makeover, the cost will be more conservative. This, combined with the fact that you really love your neighborhood might make it more sensible to fix up your home and keep enjoying your current house. </p>

<h2>4. Have a Budget Cushion</h2>

<p>As much as you and your contractor try to plan ahead, it seems like there is always something that doesn’t go according to plan. To prepare for this seemingly inevitable occurrence, always have a budget cushion. Have more money available for the remodel than you think you’ll need. That way, when you need to buy some extra materials or the contractors need to work one more day, you’ll have the funds to cover it.</p>

<h2>Choosing the Best Contractor</h2>

<p>Whether you’re planning a split-level exterior remodel or renovating your kitchen, choosing the right contractor is vital. They are the ones who will make sure that your remodel goes well, stays close to budget, and finishes on time.</p>
