<h2>1. Lead Generation Is Key</h2>

<p>You need a constant stream of customers in order to stay busy. That means, even if you’ve got work right now you always have to be working on generating new leads. Building relationships with potential customers through sites like Locate Contractors is an excellent way to do this.</p>

<h2>2. An Online Presence Is Invaluable</h2>

<p>In today’s world, you’ve got to be online. If you’re not, you’ll find it hard to generate leads. Furthermore, when you do find them, they might shy away because they can’t find you online.</p>

<h2>3. Your Reputation Is Vital</h2>

<p>Keeping up your reputation as a company is vital to success. Encourage customers to leave online reviews and don’t be too discouraged by the occasional bad one. Respond to it politely and professionally, your response has a huge impact on future readers. </p>

<h2>4. Know Your Worth</h2>

<p>Know the value of your work. Sometimes people (ahem, friends and family) will expect you to do discounted or free work. Others might demand discounts. Just know those aren’t your clients.</p>

<h2>5. Know When to Say ‘No’</h2>

<p>If you’re going to lose money on a job, or you can smell trouble from a client, it’s okay to say ‘no.’ You don’t have to accept every job that comes your way.</p>

<h2>6. Hold Onto the Good Ones</h2>

<p>Good employees are hard to find and it is worth it to do whatever it takes to hold onto the good ones. </p>

<h2>7. Understand Your Weaknesses</h2>

<p>Running a business will require you to wear a lot of hats. Don’t expect to be good at everything and be honest about your weak areas. </p>

<h2>8. Outsourcing Is Your Friend</h2>

<p>Furthermore, outsource your weak areas to people who can handle those tasks better than you. You’ll save yourself a lot of time, frustration, and even money by focusing on your strengths. </p>

<h2>9. Get Comfortable with Paper</h2>

<p>You might have started your own business because you enjoy swinging a hammer. However, you’ll quickly learn as your business grows that owning a business means dealing with a lot of paperwork. Get comfortable with it and outsource things like accounting that might be outside your realm of expertise. </p>

<h2>10. Write It All Down</h2>

<p>Write down absolutely everything! This will help eliminate confusion, frustrated or disappointed customers, and protect you in case one of your clients tries to overstep. Doesn’t matter who the job is for, always write everything down no matter how small the detail.</p>
