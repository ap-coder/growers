Things Your Contractor Is not Telling You

<p>One of the biggest frustrations homeowners have with hiring contractors is how to know who is trustworthy. After all, there’s a good reason there are tons of contracting horror stories out there. Not every contractor is as reputable as they might seem at first glance.</p>

<p>Here are just a few of the things that your contractor might not be telling you.</p>

<h2>1. I Don’t Actually Know How to Price This</h2>

<p>Pricing a job is really complicated, particularly if various subcontractors will be involved. Contractors in their zeal to offer a competitive price may find out later that the job can’t be completed for the price they quoted.</p>

<p>Sometimes it’s an honest mistake by an inexperienced contractor, other times they do it deliberately so they can charge you more later.</p>

<h2>2. I Won’t Always Be On the Job</h2>

<p>Contractors wear many hats. Once their business grows, they spend less time swinging hammers and more time pushing papers. They start hiring more employees and entrusting them with the boots on the ground part of the work.</p>

<p>This isn’t always a bad thing, as long as they’ve hired good people. But if they make you think they’ll be on the job all the time — and they aren’t — that can be disappointing.</p>

<h2>3. A Big Deposit Isn’t Necessary and May Not Be Legal</h2>

<p>Customers aren’t surprised and will happily pay a big deposit. All the contractor has to do is tell them they need the money upfront to pay for the materials to get started.</p>

<p>The truth is that an established company won’t need money to start the projects. They should be in a position to get the materials they need without charging you upfront.</p>

<p>In some situations, it may even be illegal to charge the amount they’re asking. Many states limit the deposit amount that they can charge to a percentage of the job’s price or a fixed amount.</p>

<h2>4. It Doesn’t Actually Cost that Much...But You’re a Lawyer</h2>

<p>...or a doctor or you live in an expensive neighborhood the list goes on. Some unscrupulous contractors might decide to charge more for a job simply because they think you can afford it.</p>

<p>Others say doctors are analytical and tear their work apart and doing a job for a lawyer always runs the risk of getting sued. In other words, they think these kinds of people are a pain to work with and they’ll charge more accordingly. Really, it’s just an excuse to charge more because they think they can.</p>

<h2>How to Find Honest Contractors</h2>
